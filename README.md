This add-on is a character sheet for roleplayers who like to go in adventure and roll some dice, as in a Tabletop RPG.

You will find an interface with health status, ressources, skills (up to 45), skill description, dice values for rolling and effects/costs of each skills, when it's useful.

- As a player, you will find a Character Sheet, also you can roll a skill and all the other players will be warned by a notification (in party or raid) or by an emote (if not in party or raid). DMTools can parse simple dice formula like 1d100+20, 3d6-2 and the like.
- As a GM, you will find a useful GM panel for tracking player last skill rolls, health and resources, and a turn order for displaying player turn and enemy turns and track who have rolled and who haven't.
- You will also find a Marker Panel for sharing marker informations to the players: marker names, descriptions, power level and health.
