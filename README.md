This add-on is a character sheet for roleplayers who like to go in adventure.

You will find an interface with health status, ressources, skills (up to 45), skill description, dice values for rolling and costs of each skills, when it's useful. As a player, you can roll a skill and all the other players will be warned by a notification (in party or raid) or by an emote (of not in party or raid). SkillSheet can parse simple dice formula like 1d100+20, 3d6-2 and the like.

As a GM, you will find a useful GM panel for tracking player last rolls, health and resources.
You will also found a GM panel for controling markers for your events (NPC, items, etc.) with power level, health and description.

Enjoy!
